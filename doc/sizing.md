The hardware compute and storage requirements for MOSIP core platform are estimated as below.

## Production
### Compute
Compute hardware estimates for a production deployment:

|Module|Capacity|n Servers|Configuration|
|---|---|---|---|
Pre-registration | 300 concurrent users | 20 | 4 VCPU*, 16 GB RAM |
Registration Processor | 200,000 registrations per day | 80 | 4 VCPU, 16 GB RAM|
ID Authentication | 2,000,000 auth requests per day | 20 | 4 VCPU, 16 GB RAM |
Resident Services | 300 concurrent users | 30 | 4 VCPU*, 16 GB RAM |

\* VCPU:  Virtual CPU

We estimate 30% additional compute capacitiy for administration, monitoring and maintenance. This may be optimized by the System Integrator.

**Notes**
1. High availability is taken into consideration with assumed replication factor of 2 per service pod/docker
1. The above estimates **do not** include compute servers needed for
   1. Database
   1. HDFS/CEPH
   1. Bio SDK:  compute requirements should be provided by the SDK vendor.
   1. HSM
   1. ABIS
   1. Virus scan
   1. Load balancers
   1. External IAM
   1. Disaster recovery:  Setup will be replicated, hence, double the number of servers.

### Storage
Storage estimates for production deployment:


## Dev, QA, Staging, Preprod
Additional compute and storage may be needed for the following setups.

| Environment | Setup | n Severs | Configuration | Storage |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Dev | Sandbox | 13 | 4 VCPU, 16 GB RAM | 128 GB SSD|
| QA | Sandbox | 13 | 4 VCPU, 16 GB RAM | 128 GB SSD|
| Staging | Sandbox | 13 | 4 VCPU, 16 GB RAM | 128 GB SSD|
| Pre-production | Cell | * | 4 VCPU, 16 GB RAM | * |

\* To be decided by country/System Integrator.
